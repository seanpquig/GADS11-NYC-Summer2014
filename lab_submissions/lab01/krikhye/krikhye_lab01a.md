Data analyst turned software engineer turned consultative data analyst. 

I have a BS in Mathematics. I have forgotten all the material I learned, but have retained the intellectual masochism bred by banging my head against incomprehensible material every day. 

When I first started working as a software engineer my manager told me "your code is rarely clever and usually does what it's supposed to do" which felt like an insult at the time, but in time I've come to cherish it as a compliment.
