My name is Christine Tan and I am a business school professor and a co-founder of a social BI company
I have very limited coding background; however, I conduct a lot of statistical analyses for my research using Stata
I am on facebook and Linkedin and have a very limited presence on Twitter
I enjoy reading Nate Silver's blog.
